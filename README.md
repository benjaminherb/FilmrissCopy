# Filmriss Copy Version 0.1

This is a small program for copying and checking video/audio files for onset backups. You have the option for up to two sources and two destinations and the copied data will be verified via MD5Checksum Calculations. In case the copy process was interrupted there is the option to use RSYNC to copy the missing files. Log files for the complete process are stored in the destinations as well as in a "filmrisscopy_logs" folder where the script is located.  

The created folder structure looks like this:  
.../Project/Date_Projekt_ReelName/Source
